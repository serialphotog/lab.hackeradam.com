Hello and welcome to my lab notebook. This is where I will keep my public working notes on projects that I am working on and subjects I am researching at any given moment. The idea behind this is that this site serves as a publicly accessible notebook of sorts. As such, content here is less polished than it would be on my [main blog](https://hackeradam.com). 

This is an idea that I've gotten through seeing a similar setup from others online. Some other great examples of lab notebooks that I've come across are:

* [Brian Gianforcaro's Lab Notebook](https://lab.bjg.io/)
* [White Quark's Lab Notebook](https://lab.whitequark.org/)
* [James Munss' Lab Notebook](https://lab.jamesmunns.com/intro.html)

# About this Notebook

This lab notebook is a simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site. The code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/serialphotog/lab.hackeradam.com) and the changes are automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages, similar to [how I do my main site](https://hackeradam.com/post/new-site-stack/).
